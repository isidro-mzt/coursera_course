 <h1>She Walks in Beauty</h1>
  <h3>Lord Byron</h3>
  <div class="row">
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <h2>Part I</h2>
    <p> She walks in Beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <h2>Part II</h2>
    <p>One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
    <h2>Part III</h2>
    <p>And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!</p>
